 # Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview  
Customer churn is a critical issue for subscription-based businesses. In this project, the goal is to build a predictive model that can identify customers at risk of churning so that marketing teams can intervene with targeted retention campaigns.

## Business Context  
Customer acquisition costs are significantly higher than retention costs. By proactively predicting churn, companies can improve customer lifetime value (CLTV) and reduce revenue loss.

## Dataset  
We use the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle, which contains approximately 7,000 customer records with demographic data, account information, and service usage details.

## Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Distribution of churn rates  
- Key relationships (e.g., contract type vs churn)  
- Missing values and data quality assessment

## Data Preprocessing  
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Feature scaling

## Modeling Approach  
- Algorithms tried: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- Model Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, ROC AUC  
- Cross-validation strategy to prevent overfitting  
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

## Results & Insights  
- Best model: XGBoost, ROC AUC = 0.85  
- Important features: contract length, monthly charges, tenure  
- Business recommendation: Focus retention efforts on customers with month-to-month contracts and higher monthly charges

## Challenges  
- Class imbalance required oversampling techniques (SMOTE)  
- Feature selection to reduce noise

## Next Steps  
- Build a customer dashboard for real-time churn monitoring  
- Incorporate additional behavioral data for improved accuracy
